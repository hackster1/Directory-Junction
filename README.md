# Directory-Junction
This File Will accept input Source Directory: path of folder for which you want to create directory Junction
Target Directory : Path of folder where you want to keep all the files and create a Directory Junction

It will move all the files from source to target and then create the Junction between these two paths

Feel free to let me know if you find any bugs
